This file is for logging any possible improvements/bugs/issues we know about.

1. The Database accepts duplicate entries. Could probably wait to fix this after we stop using sqlite3

2. Need an easy way to switch between searching ebay/craigslist/both. This is going to require adding a checkbox,
drop down, or something else on the front end. Then, we can hook it up to the back end quite easily.

3. the results display is just a list that lists all the fields in the format:
    website, title, price, url, partID. It looks quite messy. search_results.html controls this format right now.
